# MediaCV-NFT

MediaCV-NFT is an open-source cloud-native platform for building an NFT Marketplace on top of Algorand blockchain. 

Learn more on our official [case study](https://staging.ulam.io/case-studies/whitelabel-nft-marketplace-by-ulam-labs/). 

# Getting started with MediaCV-NFT

There are three components involved in the platform. The frontend, the backend, and the smart contracts. The backend and frontend parts of the application have to be deployed to a server. Smart contracts are automatically deployed by the platform when new NFTs are created.

Follow the instructions below to prepare your development environment or to deploy the application to a public server.

# How to deploy to Microsoft Azure

To deploy MediaCV-NFT we'll need to create a database, a Kubernetes cluster on the Microsoft Azure, and install several associated tools. This guide assumes that the user has at least some proficiency in using the Microsoft Azure.

### Prerequisites

- [Microsoft Azure SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Kubernetes Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- SQL Database on Microsoft Azure
- Container Registry on Microsoft Azure

### Creating a Kubernetes cluster

1. Initialize your Microsoft Azure SDK by running `azure init` and following the instructions
1. Go to [Kubernetes Engine](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/)
2. Click on `Create`
3. Configure your cluster - for experimenting, we suggest using the `Standard` cluster with the pre-filled configuration and reduced number of nodes (depending on your budget).
  - To reduce the number of nodes go to `default-pool`, change `Number of nodes` to `1`.
4. Wait for your cluster to be provisioned
6. Click on the `Actions` button, select `Connect` and run provided command to connect to your cluster
7. After that you should be able to access your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl` command. We suggest reading [Overview of kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).

### Backend deployment

The `backend` folder contains `helm` folder that contains Helm chart. Helm charts help to manage the complexity of Kubernetes application deployment. Before deploying we'll need to configure our Helm chart and install [Kubernetes Nginx Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/)

#### Configuration

- Inside the `values.yaml` file, set the `host_dns` variable to your domain
- Inside the `secrets.yaml` file, configure:
    - `DATABASE_URL` - URL to access the database compatible with [dj-database-url](https://github.com/jacobian/dj-database-url)
    - `PURESTAKE_API_KEY` - Purestake API Key
    - `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` - Credentials for Google Service Account encoded in base64

#### Deployment

1. Connect your Docker to your Container Registry on Microsoft Azure- https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/advanced-authentication
1. Create Kubernetes namespace using `kubectl create namespace <insert-namespace-name-here>`
2. Switch to that namespace using `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>`
3. Run `make image && make push && make deploy`
4. Check if the containers are running using `kubectl get pods`
5. Switch to `nginx-ingress` Kubernetes namespace and get the IP number of the Nginx server using `kubectl get services`
6. Create a Load Balancer that points to that Nginx server


### Frontend deployment

For deploying the frontend we suggest [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) which can be connected to a Github repository and takes care of the deployment for you.

# Creating an NFT

1. Go to the admin panel in the backend part of the application
2. Click on `Users` in the `API` section of the admin panel
3. Click on `Add user`
4. Enter your Algorand address and select `Is Staff`
5. Click on `Save`
6. Visit the frontend part of the application
7. Connect with your wallet
8. Click on the arrow next to your address at the top bar
9. Select `Create new NFT`
10. Proceed according to the instructions displayed on the screen


# How to setup the development environment

## Backend

By default, the project is configured with an SQLite database, which is embedded into the application and doesn't require any separate installation. We'll only RabbitMQ as a message queue for the background worker. For the application to be fully functional we need both a server and a background worker.

### RabbitMQ
Running RabbitMQ with Docker:

 1. Install and run [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
 2. Run `docker run -d -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3` - this will run RabbitMQ in the background and forward the `5672` port to your computer.

Manual installation:

 1. Download, install and run [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
 2. By default, RabbitMQ will listen on port 5672 on all available interfaces. Refer to https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html if you want to customize your configuration.

By default, MediaCV-NFT is configured to connect to RabbitMQ hosted on localhost at port 5672. If you want to change it you can set the `CELERY_BROKER_URL` variable in your command-line environment or inside the `backend/settings_dev.py` file. 

Example value of `CELERY_BROKER_URL`:
`amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672//`

For more information refer to `Broker Settings` section of [Celery documentation](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/userguide/configuration.html).

Alternatively, you can install RabbitMQ yourself and configure it to accept connections on port 5672.

### Configuration

You can set the configuration variables both in your shell environment or `backend/settings_dev.py` file.

`PURESTAKE_API_KEY` should to be equal to your [Purestake](https://www.purestake.com/) API key.
`USE_TESTNET` should be equal to `0` if you want to use MainNet infrastructure.

### Running development server
 1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 and [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
 2.  Go to `backend` folder
 3. Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies and `poetry shell` to start using a virtual environment which contains those dependencies
 4. Migrate the database using `python manage.py migrate` command
 5. Create admin account using `python manage.py createsuperuser` command, following the instructions on the screen.
 6. Run the development server with `python manage.py runserver`
 7. You can access the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin/

### Running background worker

 1. Follow the section above to install the dependencies and run `poetry shell` inside `backend` folder.
 2. Run `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=nft_market.settings_dev celery -A nft_market.celery worker --loglevel=DEBUG` and keep it running alongside the development server to test the application

## Frontend

### Configuration

The frontend configuration can be found in `/frontend/src/config/index.js`. It contains the following variables:
 - `ALGORAND_LEDGER` - determines the infrastructure that we want to use. Can be `MainNet` or `TestNet`.
 - `USDC_ID` - Identifier of Algorand Standard Asset which is going to be used as a stablecoin
 - `USDC_DECIMAL_POINTS` - the amount of decimal points for that asset
 - `BACKEND_URL` - URL of the backend part of the application. By default, it is `http://localhost:8000` for the development environment and `https://nft-be.ulam.io` for the production environment.

## Contract

It is necessary to run a contract development environment only if you want to introduce changes to it.

### Dependencies

- You'll need to download the [algorand-builder](https://github.com/scale-it/algorand-builder) repository and link the `algob` and `runtime` packages. The latest tested commit for  `algorand-builder` is `0cf0f338230521197079e292a4963e814fa574f2`.
    - To link the `algorand-builder` you need to build it using `yarn build`
    - Issue `yarn link` command in those folders: `packages/algob`, `packages/runtime`
    - Run `yarn link "@algorand-builder/algob"` and `yarn link "@algorand-builder/runtime"` in the contract directory
- To install the rest of the dependencies run:
    - `poetry install`
    - `yarn install`

### Useful commands

Commands should be run inside the poetry shell.

Here are some useful commands:
- `yarn test` - running tests
- `yarn algob compile` - contract compilation
- `yarn deploy` - contract deployment (requires configuring `algob.config.js` and setting ASA identifiers in `scripts/deploy.js`)

### Debugging

Algorand has a debugging tool called `tealdbg` which allows real-time debugging of the contract execution. To debug a transaction you need to supply a teal file with the contract and a dry-run of the transaction:

- `tealdbg debug state.teal --dryrun-req tx.dr` - `tealdbg` will provide you with an address that you can enter in your browser to run the debugger

### Obtaining dry-run

Dry-run can be obtained with the goal command-line tool when issuing a transaction:

- `goal app call --app-id {appid} --from {ACCOUNT} --out=dumptx.dr --dryrun-dump`

Dry-run can be also extracted from the user interface:

- First, you need to extract the transaction which is sent to the Algorand node by the frontend part of the application
- Then you need to convert it from base64 to binary form and save it to a file
    - You can use `base64 -d` to convert the base64 text to a binary form in the *nix command-line
- At last, you need to convert the binary form to dry-run using `goal clerk dryrun -t tx.bin --dryrun-dump -o tx.dr`
